# Demo Scenes

The **Demo** folder contains a series of scenes that illustrate three typical use cases involving Page Sliders, showcasing both static and dynamic content, as well as lazy loading behavior.

**Note:** All demo scenes are using the old Unity input module. The `Event System` uses the `Standalone Input Module` from old unity input manager.

## Static Content

- **Description**: A Page Slider featuring a fixed, predefined set of pages and content.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where all content is known in advance and doesn't change after the initial setup.
- **Tutorial**: Check the [tutorial](./setup-editor.md) for a step-by-step guide on setting up static content.

## Dynamic Content

- **Description**: A Page Slider where pages and content are generated or added dynamically during runtime.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications where content is updated or modified based on user actions or data that isn't available at the start.
- **Tutorial**: Check the [tutorial](./setup-runtime.md) for a step-by-step guide on setting up dynamic content.

## Lazy Loading

- **Description**: A Page Slider with dynamically added content that is loaded only when required (on demand).
- **Use Case**: Useful for improving performance and resource management by loading content only when it's needed, particularly for large datasets or when loading content could impact performance.
